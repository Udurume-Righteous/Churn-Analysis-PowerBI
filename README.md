# Churn-Analysis-PowerBI
Interactive churn‑analysis dashboard built in Power BI, including DAX measures, model diagram, and insights.

## Project Overview

This Power BI project explores a customer churn dataset to understand why customers stop using services and identify strategies to improve retention. Using Power BI’s powerful data modeling and DAX capabilities, the analysis highlights behavior patterns, service usage, demographics, and tenure-based trends that influence churn.

The project delivers actionable insights through interactive dashboards and visual storytelling — ideal for business teams seeking to reduce churn and increase customer lifetime value.

## Key Insights Summary

### Demographics
- Senior citizens had significantly higher churn rates compared to younger customers.
- Customers without family ties (no partner or dependents) churned more frequently, suggesting emotional attachment may reduce churn.

### Tenure & Loyalty
- Customers in their first year (0–12 months) were the most likely to churn.
- The longer a customer stays, the lower the churn risk — emphasizing the importance of first-year engagement.

### Services & Infrastructure
- Customers with Fiber Optic internet had the highest churn — possibly due to pricing or service issues.
- Those without any internet service rarely churned, likely representing low-risk or dormant accounts.

### Streaming & Bundles
- Customers using both Streaming TV and Movies showed slightly lower churn, hinting at engagement benefits from content bundling.
- High churn was seen among customers who had only one service, reinforcing bundling as a potential retention tool.

### Contracts & Billing
- Customers on month-to-month contracts had dramatically higher churn than those on yearly or 2-year plans.
- Electronic payments were associated with higher churn, possibly due to easier cancellation.

## Recommendations

- **Engage First-Year Customers Proactively**  
  Focus retention efforts (onboarding, offers, check-ins) within the first 12 months when churn risk is highest.

- **Target High-Churn Segments**  
  Offer loyalty programs or discounts to senior citizens and single customers — groups that showed higher churn.

- **Encourage Longer Contracts**  
  Provide incentives for customers to switch to annual contracts, which are linked to lower churn.

- **Bundle Services Strategically**  
  Promote combinations of streaming and phone/internet services to increase engagement and stickiness.

- **Monitor Fiber Optic Experience**  
  Investigate why Fiber customers are churning — is it service quality, pricing, or unmet expectations?

- **Improve Early Engagement**  
  Personalized messaging, onboarding support, or early discounts could improve satisfaction within the first 3–6 months.
